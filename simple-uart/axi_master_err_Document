test_3.py:	to check the whether the data written in the Baud reg was correct
		o/p: data read was written correctly

test_4.py:	write burst of one data 'a'
		data read form TX reg was correct.
		BRESP was OKAY(no errror)
		RRESP was OKAY(no errror)

test_5.py:	write burst of three data 'a','b','c'
	  	data read from the TX reg was in order what we send and it was correct.
	  	And we where sending BREADY and was checking BRESP for each beat in the write burst.
	  	and aslo we got slave error in BRESP after 'c' is written.
	 	and slave error in RRESP after reading 'a'.

teat_6.py:	was written based on the condition given in the spec 
		"For a write transaction, a single response is signaled for the entire burst, and not for each data transfer within the burst" 
		write burst of three data 'a','b','c' 
		data read from the TX reg was in order what we send and it was incorrect only 'c' was read.
		BRESP was OKAY (no error)
		

		It seems that the transfer from SIN to SOUT occur only after each beat write response is checked. 


observation from vcd file for test5 & test 6:

		"the slave must wait for both WVALID and WREADY to be asserted before asserting BVALID"
   		"the slave must also wait for WLAST to be asserted before asserting BVALID"
		not working

		in test5.vcd
		bvalid is not deasserted even after WVALID and WLAST MADE TO '0'

		BVALID signal is not proper and its going on writing '62'


		same errorin test6.vcd
